# cppnnml
The C++ Neural Network and Machine Learning project is intended to provide a C++ template library for neural nets and machine learning algorithms as well as a Q format library. The neural networks and machine learning algorithms combined with Q format can be run on embedded systems with very low compute resources. It does not rely upon FPU, GPU, or vectorized instructions.

# Getting started:
